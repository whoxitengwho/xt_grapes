#### Introduction
**xt_grapes** is a high-performance dynamic process and thread pool management framework implemented in C. It is designed to support elastic resource scheduling in high-concurrency production environments.

#### Architecture
The framework adopts a “grapevine” structure: the main process acts as the vine, subprocesses are like branches, and threads resemble grapes. This design enables dynamic creation, scalable management, flexible expansion, and cooperative operation.

 
## Key Features

- 🚀 **Dynamic Scalability**: Automatically adjusts the number of processes and threads based on runtime configuration and system load.
- ⚙️ **Unified Resource Management**: Unified process and thread pool management with cross-module scheduling capability.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Scheduling Strategies**: Supports custom algorithms for concurrency monitoring and adaptive load balancing.
- 🍇 **Grapelike Architecture**: Thread/process structure modeled as a grape bunch — main process as the stem, subprocesses and threads as grapes.
- 🧩 **Modular and Embeddable**: Easy to embed into existing C-based applications, modular and refactor-friendly.
- 🛡️ **Stable and Robust**: Production-ready with crash isolation and reliable resource management.

## Suitable Use Cases

- High-concurrency C/C++ gateway-server applications
- Background batch job schedulers
- Container-friendly microservices with lightweight worker coordination
- Multi-task execution engine for memory-constrained systems
